        <li>Each line uses its tax class: the variation&apos;s class if it overrides the product, otherwise the product&apos;s. Exempt and non-taxable products are never taxed.</li>
        <li>
          For that class, the enabled rate with the most specific location wins: <strong className="text-foreground">postcode &gt; district &gt; division &gt; country</strong> (the country rate is the fallback). No match → untaxed.
        </li>
        <li>One rate per line — rates never stack. Only one enabled rate is allowed per class and location.</li>

        <li>Discounts come off before tax. Line amounts are rounded half-up to the paisa.</li>
        <li>
          Tax is calculated once per applied rate on the combined amount at that rate, rounded half-up to the paisa. Prices that exclude tax get <em>amount × rate</em> added; prices that include tax have <em>amount × rate ÷ (100 + rate)</em> extracted.
        </li>
        <li>Shipping is taxed only when enabled, at the rate matched for the chosen shipping class, using the same included/excluded setting.</li>
        <li>New orders keep a snapshot of the settings and matched rates; editing rates never changes existing orders.</li>
